# first-personal-website
followed a tutorial on how to make a personal website for myself

This was a side project that I tried prior to the start of bootcamp.

Used HTML/CSS/JS to create a simple landing page for a basic, personal website.

Things I learned:
-Basic manipulation of HTML, CSS, and JS.
